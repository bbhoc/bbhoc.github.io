(These directions are counter-clockwise, but there’s a big debate among BBH staff as to which direction is best. Try them both!). Enjoy the mellow, boulder strewn forests between #7 and #21. At #21, bear left. You’ll pass through some old clearings and if you look closely you’ll see a water spring hidden amongst the ferns to the right. At the top of the hill, you’ll enter an open clearing and then catch your first glimpse of the Hogback view. The Adirondack mountains are to your west, the Taconic Ridge to the southwest, and the Green Mountains to the east with Brandon Gap to the southeast. Be on the lookout for wild blueberries in the summer. There is an old footpath that climbs up Hogback, and the views get better as you climb. In the 1940’s, Hogback was a small downhill ski area! Stay on the trail until you drop down to a gravel road, and turn left. Follow the road for 150 meters until you come to intersection #25, which heads off to the left away from the gravel road. Keep trekking until you reach intersection #27 and bear right. You’ll head up a short hill, and then it’s all downhill to the Inn! Stay left at #29, and then continue downhill to intersection #15 and bear right to #11. Continue downhill to #7.
